# Encrypt-Decrypt
a simple script that encrypts and decrypts text files using a key

This script was made to teach myself how to use the symmectric encryption, Fernet.
Going to commit more stuff to make this script a little better later on.

How to use:
1. Must have python and pip installed
2. git clone repository
3. cd into the repository
4. install requirements using this command: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. run python script: python crypt.py
